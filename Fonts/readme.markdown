Chunk

_by [Meredith Mandel](http://www.meredithmandel.com/)_

Chunk is an ultra-bold slab serif typeface that is reminiscent of old American Western woodcuts, broadsides, and newspaper headlines. Used mainly for display, the fat block lettering is unreserved yet refined for contemporary use.

League Gothic
=============
_by [Caroline Hadilaksono](http://www.hadilaksono.com) & [Micah Rich](http://micahrich.com)_

League Gothic is a revival of an old classic, and one of our favorite typefaces, Alternate Gothic #1. It was originally designed by [Morris Fuller Benton](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Morris_Fuller_Benton) for the [American Type Founders Company](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/American_Type_Founders) in 1903. The company went bankrupt in 1993, and since the original typeface was created before 1923, the typeface is in the public domain.

We decided to make our own version, and contribute it to the Open Source Type Movement.

League Script Number One

_by [Haley Fiege](http://www.kingdomofawesome.com)_

This ain’t no Lucinda. League Script #1 is a modern, coquettish script font that sits somewhere between your high school girlfriend’s love notes and handwritten letters from the ’20s. Designed exclusively for the League of Moveable Type, it includes ligatures and will act as the framework for future script designs.

Raleway
========
_by [Matt McInerney](http://pixelspread.com)_

Raleway is an elegant sans-serif typeface, designed in a single thin weight. It is a display face that features both old style and lining numerals, standard and discretionary ligatures, a pretty complete set of diacritics, as well as a stylistic alternate inspired by more geometric sans-serif typefaces than it's neo-grotesque inspired default character set.
