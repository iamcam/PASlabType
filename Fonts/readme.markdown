##Adding additional fonts

To add additional fonts...

 1. Copy the otf or ttf file into your project
 2. In YourAmazingApp-Info.plist file, add the key *"Fonts provided by application"*
 3. Add the font file name as an entry: Item 0 : Some Font.otf
 4. The rest is up to you in your app. Use the demo app to help you identify how to reference the fonts. You will need their postscript names, which aren't always immediately obvious.
